## ðŸ“Œ About the Project

The **Automated Elective Processing** system is a web application that automates the allocation of elective preferences for students on a **first-come, first-serve** basis. The system dynamically adjusts the number of electives and their credits based on the academic year. If multiple students opt for the same elective, allocations are made based on preference priority. If demand exceeds **150%**, additional sections are created based on faculty availability.

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Features:
- **Student Login**: Secure authentication to access elective preferences.
- **Elective Selection**: Allows students to reserve and prioritize electives.
- **Automated Allocation**: Assigns electives based on availability and student preference.
- **Elective Change Module**: Provides an option to change electives under specific conditions.
- **Reporting System**: Generates reports on student allocations, faculty assignments, and elective changes.
